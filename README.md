# Next JS 13+, Tailwind CSS 3.2 and TypeScript 

Built-in feature from Next.js:

- â˜• Minify HTML & CSS
- ðŸ’¨ Live reload
- âœ… Cache busting

### Philosophy

- All the Next.js pages are statically generated by default. You can easily switch to SSR adding `getServerSideProps` to your page.
- Nothing is hidden from you, so you have the freedom to make the necessary adjustments to fit your needs and preferences.
- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- ðŸš€ Production-ready
